# Deep inpute for Sensors missing data

This is a Deep Learning method that handle the missing data problem in the context of sensor data.

The method is based on a denoinsing Autoencoder that learn complex patterns useful for impute data in the missing part.

We avaliable this method from two point of views. The firs one is the reconstruction metrics, in terms of mean squared error. 
The second one is in terms of the performance of the reconstructed data in a task. 
The chosen task is the human activity recognition based on sensor data. 
We achieve the state of art in both metrics in the USC-HAD dataset.
